# Introduction
The Rookout desktop app makes it easy to view local files in your browser.

# About
Rookout is a data extraction and pipelining platform, which provides the ability to collect any piece of data from live code, on-demand, using non-breaking breakpoints (Learn more about Rookout on the website or the docs).

The Rookout desktop app allows you to navigate through your local projects in a simple and flexible manner. Use this app in combination with the Rookout web debugger to set non-breaking breakpoints in your source files, and to instantly apply them to live code. 

- Ease of use - set up once and easily access any directory or file you choose directly from the browser. No need to manually open or refresh files and folders; no additional privileges needed.
- Git aware - seamlessly access your source code across all devices where the app is installed, regardless of the local paths to which youâ€™ve cloned a git repositoryto. Easily collaborate with fellow developers working on the same code base. 
- Security - maintain strict control over the files you open for sharing and the websites that can access them. Rookout will never collect or modify your source code. 

# Security

At Rookout we take your source code security very seriously. Rookout will never collect or modify your source code. 

The Rookout Desktop App was designed with security as a foremost concern, its security features are as follows:
- The App only listens for connections from localhost.
- The App only allows access to folders you have chosen. Path traversal is disallowed.
- The App requires authentication using a secure token for accessing the file system.
- On the first installation, the App will be paired with your Rookout user to allow automatic authentication.
